SGRN: A Cas12a-driven Synthetic Gene Regulatory Network System (code to accompany manuscript)

This repository contains code (and data) to reproduce the results in our manuscript entitled "SGRN: A Cas12a-driven Synthetic Gene Regulatory Network System".

There are two directories - `flow` and `microscopy`.

1. The `flow` directory includes two subdirectories - `set_processing` and `results_combining`. The `set_processing` directory includes code for processing raw flow cytometry fcs files (which can be obtained at [flowrepository.org](http://flowrepository.org)), generating plots and create results tables for each replicate batch of each experiment reported in the manuscript. The `results_combining` directory includes code for merging each replicate set of an experiment into a single unified table of results for that experiment. The funal unified tables used for analysis can be downloaded from OSF ([here](https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/uj9hs/providers/osfstorage/6459fdf76ef971290a77184a/?zip=)). This downloads a zipped `results_tables` directory. Finally, the `flow` directory also includes R code (`linear_model_code.R`) for reproducing all the results figures and running the linear modeling-based tests of significance. If you download and unzip the `results_tables` described above and set the working directory to the directory containing `results_tables`, the `linear_model_code.R` can be run without further modification.

2. The `microscopy` directory contains the R code used to pre-process the imaging measurements generated using the Nikon Elements software (`Nuclear_GFP_localization_image_analysis.R`). The raw data used as input for this script can be obtained [here](https://osf.io/download/uk5yn/) and the plate map is available [here](https://osf.io/download/umzt4/). This directory also includes the R code (`single_cell_imaging_data.R`) necessary to generate a violin plot and the various tests of significance reported. The data table used as input for this script can be downloaded [here](https://osf.io/download/gzn29/) and the data table output by this script for the manuscript can be downloaded [here](https://osf.io/download/jh4d9/). The original images used in this study are also available at [osf.io](https://osf.io/ds5v9/).
